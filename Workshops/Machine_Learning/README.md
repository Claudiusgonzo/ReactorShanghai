| Making Your Data Useful for Analysis (ML1) | Having complete and accurate data is a critical first step to being able to learn from it, but part of the complexity of data science is narrowing down what part of the data is important. In this introductory workshop to Machine Learning you will begin to understand how to narrow down the feature scope of your data so that the predictions are based on causation and not just correlation. | [Learning Materials found at: aka.ms/ReactorML1](https://aka.ms/ReactorML1) | [Machine Learning 1 Workshop Slides](https://reactorworkshops.blob.core.windows.net/workshopslides/Machine-Learning-1-Dec-2019.pptx) |
| Using Advanced Machine Learning Models (ML2) | What happens when you encounter large data sets that are more nuanced than a set of concrete numbers? When you begin to explore natural language, or data sets with many potential influential features, you require more complex and predictive machine learning models. In this advanced Data Science workshop, learn about K-Means, Naive Bayes, and Regression models that will better support complex data and questions.  | [Learning Materials found at: aka.ms/ReactorML2](https://aka.ms/ReactorML2) | [Machine Learning 2 Workshop Slides](https://reactorworkshops.blob.core.windows.net/workshopslides/Machine-Learning-2-Dec-2019.pptx) |
